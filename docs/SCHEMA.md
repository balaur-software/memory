# SCHEMA.md — the data contract

This file is the library's real API: the SQLite schema, its semantics, and
its numbered invariants. Code in any language that honors this file is a
conforming implementation. Changes here are contract changes: they bump
`meta.schema_version` and ship with a migration.

Two files:

- **`memory.db`** — the record. Source of truth, backed up, treated as
  precious.
- **`index.db`** — the sidecar. FTS + vectors, derived entirely from
  `memory.db`. **Deleting it is always safe** (I13); it rebuilds from source.

Conventions: timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC with milliseconds
(`2026-07-05T20:14:03.123Z`), stored as TEXT. IDs are lowercase ULIDs
(26 chars, Crockford base32) — time-prefixed, so lexical order is creation
order. JSON columns hold canonical JSON objects, never arrays at the top
level, `{}` when empty.

```

### Version 2 — identity resolution (docs/ENTITIES.md)

```sql
-- Names a node also answers to. One alias may point at MANY nodes (two
-- different Anas): lookups return candidates, never a winner.
CREATE TABLE aliases (
  alias   TEXT NOT NULL,   -- normalized (lowercase, collapsed whitespace)
  node_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  source  TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (source IN ('owner','merge')),
  created TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (alias, node_id)
) STRICT;
CREATE INDEX idx_aliases_node ON aliases(node_id);

-- Open identity questions (Phase B writes these): unordered pair, a < b.
CREATE TABLE identity_pending (
  a        TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  b        TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  evidence TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (evidence IN ('title_match','token_subset','alias_match')),
  created  TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (a, b)
) STRICT;
```

Aliases are content: they join the FTS `extra` column (an alias hit
surfaces the node in recall) and the forget cascade deletes them (I6).

## index.db (disposable)

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE nodes_fts USING fts5(
  id UNINDEXED, kind UNINDEXED, title, content, extra
);
CREATE TABLE vectors (
  id    TEXT NOT NULL,              -- node id
  model TEXT NOT NULL,              -- host-declared vector-space identity
  dim   INTEGER NOT NULL,
  vec   BLOB NOT NULL,              -- little-endian float32, length = dim*4
  PRIMARY KEY (id, model)
) STRICT;
```

## System edge types

| type | source → target | written by | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `links` | any → any | host | generic association (default) |
| `on_day` | node → day node | library | episodic anchor at creation |
| `supersedes` | new → old | library (Decide) | validity chain; old is archived |
| `merged_into` | duplicate → survivor | library | entity-resolution outcome |
| `no_match` | a ↔ b | library (Decide) | owner ruled distinct — never re-propose (I9) |
| `derived_from` | artifact → source | library (recordDerivation) | lineage; cascade root |

## Status semantics

| status | meaning | reachable from | leaves to |
|---|---|---|---|
| proposed | agent-authored, awaiting owner | (birth) | active, rejected |
| active | part of memory | proposed, archived, quarantined | archived, quarantined, forgotten |
| archived | soft-retired; recallable only by direct query | active | active, forgotten |
| rejected | owner said no; terminal | proposed | — |
| quarantined | actively suppressed everywhere; ask-twice; optional `review_at` | active | active, forgotten |
| forgotten | content destroyed (tombstone); terminal | active, archived, quarantined, merged | — |
| merged | duplicate folded into a survivor; content-preserving husk | active | forgotten |

## Invariants (conformance fixtures reference these by number)

- **I1 — Consent boundary.** A node whose type has `born_status='proposed'`
  enters as `proposed` when `author`/agent-authored, and only an owner
  decision moves it to `active`/`rejected`. Owner-authored nodes are born
  `active`.
- **I2 — Recall filter.** Ambient recall (`recall`, `search`) returns only
  `status='active' AND surfacing='always'` nodes. `surfacing='ask'` nodes
  are returned only when the query names them (explicit term hit on title),
  never via broad matching. `surfacing='never'` nodes are reachable only by
  `getNode(id)`.
- **I3 — Traversal filter.** Graph reads (`neighborhood`) return active
  nodes only.
- **I4 — Write-time gate.** `propose` MUST route: normalized-title equality
  vs a pending proposal → merge into it (`merged_pending`); vs an active
  node of the same type → no write at all (`exists_active`); else create
  (`created`). Normalization: lowercase, collapse whitespace.
- **I5 — Adjudication is compound and ordered.** `approve_superseding`
  performs: activate new → archive old → write `supersedes` edge → audit.
  A mid-sequence failure stops and surfaces; no silent rollback of audited
  steps.
- **I6 — Tombstone semantics.** `forget` sets `status='forgotten'`,
  `title=''`, `body=''`, `props='{}'`, `origin=''`, `author=''`; clears
  `pending_edits` and (v2) the node's `aliases`; deletes the node's edges;
  scrubs it from `nodes_fts` and `vectors`; marks `derivations` rows with
  it as `source` stale; lists merged husks chained into it as `husk:<id>`
  in the report's `needsOwner` (computed before the edges drop). The row,
  `type`, and timestamps survive.
- **I7 — Content-free forget audit.** Audit entries for forget-class actions
  carry ids and counts only. No audit row anywhere carries node title/body
  text.
- **I8 — Terminality.** `rejected` and `forgotten` have no outgoing
  transitions. `merged` is terminal for the FSM and for identity verdicts,
  with one deliberate exception: a husk still holds content, so `forget`
  may destroy it (ENTITIES.md amendment).
- **I9 — No re-litigation.** After a `no_match` edge exists between two
  nodes (either direction): (a) no candidate rule ever re-inserts the pair
  into `identity_pending`, and (b) `decideIdentity(..., "same")` on the
  pair is refused. Answered means answered — the Apple Photos lesson.
- **I10 — Provenance at birth.** Every insert into `nodes` sets `origin`
  (host-supplied; `''` only for owner-manual creations). `author` is set
  whenever content carries a third party's words.
- **I11 — Timestamps and IDs.** All times UTC ISO-8601 with ms; all ids
  lowercase ULID. `updated >= created` always.
- **I12 — Audit coverage.** Every mutation of `nodes`, `edges`,
  `pending_edits`, and every decision writes exactly one audit row
  (compound decisions: one per step plus one summary).
- **I13 — Disposable index.** Deleting `index.db` loses no information;
  `rebuildIndex()` reconstructs it from `memory.db` exactly (FTS rows for
  active nodes only; vectors are re-suppliable by the host).
- **I14 — Single writer.** One `Store` instance owns writes to a given
  `memory.db`. WAL mode permits concurrent external readers (e.g., a future
  balaur mounting the file read-only).

## Divergences from balaur (deliberate)

- ULIDs, not 15-char PocketBase-style ids; strict ISO timestamps, not
  `2006-01-02 15:04:05.000Z`.
- `importance`, `surfacing`, provenance are real columns, not `props` keys —
  they carry invariants; JSON is for host-defined data only.
- Pending edits are a table, not a `props` envelope — the queue is queryable.
- `STRICT` tables throughout.
