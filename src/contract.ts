/**
 * The DRAFT Store contract — the reviewable shape of the library. Phase 1
 * (docs/MIGRATION.md) replaces this interface with the concrete Store class
 * over memory.db + index.db; it exists now so the surface can be criticized
 * before it is load-bearing. Changes are free until Phase 1 ships.
 *
 * Everything is SYNCHRONOUS (DESIGN.md): bun:sqlite is sync, personal scale
 * is sub-millisecond, and the one truly async concern — embedding text —
 * lives in hosts. Vectors in, never models.
